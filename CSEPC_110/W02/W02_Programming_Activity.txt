# The last name should be converted from whatever the user types to be displayed in ALL CAPS.

# The job title should be displayed so that the first letter is capitalized.

# The email address should be displayed in all lowercase.

#========================

# Prompt for all of the necessary values and store them in variables. Then display each item to the screen, without worrying about any spacing, punctuation, or formatting yet.

# Arrange the display so that the spacing and punctuation exactly match the example shown.

# Use the built-in string functions to make the last name display in all caps, the job title display in "title case," and the email display in all lowercase.

#========================

# Add hair color and eye color and put them both on the same line in the display.

# Add a field for the name of the month they started and also a yes/no field for whether they have completed advanced training. Put these both on the same line in the display.

# For the two lines that you just added, make it so that the second columns align, regardless of how many letters are in the responses.

# To complete this one, you may need to search the internet for something like, "python spacing format" or something similar to see if you get any ideas.
