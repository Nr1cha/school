# Write a program to compute the areas of three different shapes. 
# Prompt for the necessary information, then compute and display the area, as follows:
# Make sure that your program can appropriately handle decimal values as well as whole numbers.

# 01 Square—The area is the length of a side squared.
# 02 Rectangle—The area is the length multiplied by the width.
# 03 Circle—The area is Pi (you can use 3.14) multiplied by the radius squared.



area_of_square = input("What is the length of a side of the square? ")
print(f"The area of the square is: ",area_of_square,'\n')

area_of_rectangle = input("What is the length of a side of the rectangle? ")
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: ",area_of_rectangle,'\n')

area_of_circle = input("What is the length of a side of the circle? ")
print(f"The area of the circle is: ",area_of_circle)
