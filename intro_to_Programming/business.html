    <h1>Tek Community center</h1>
    <p>community centers are a common setting in most cities. The difference with this community center is that
        it combines what is found in the common setting of community centers and ads a more commonplace social setting
        by
        mixing it with an electronic store that fixes computers/electronics at a great discount.
    </p>
    <p>One reason to combine the two is to still provide the same resources of normal community centers and to
        include the addition of a tech center at large discounts. People who really need computer maintenance
        can also continue to gain a discount by attending computer building classes and assist with their own
        repairs.
