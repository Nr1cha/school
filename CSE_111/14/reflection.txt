Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
this semester, i noticed how valuable functions where when i realized that they can process
any valid data that is passed into them. knowing that functions can do many things was great but,
knowing that i can have functions for anything that i need is great to have. 



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
they ensure that when i've created the function, it works for sure before pushing any of 
my code to production. they are a great way to help streamline the additional overhead between
the developer and the tester. 



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
when i look at an issue, i begin by folding all my code blocks down and grouping it all together. 
additionally i will then review comments in the code to see what it's doing. 
forthermore, i will check the scope and identify global vs local scope. 

what i need to do to improve my process is finding any print and return statements and making sure
they are in the correct scope. i also need to practice my data types more because different
data types use different methods for similar tasks. i also need to be in the habit of updating documentation
while i'm coding to ensure that i can get back on track faster.
