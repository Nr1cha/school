\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program\
\
(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge\
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the\
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we\
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.\
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or\
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the\
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)\
\
1. What is the title of your program? Word_counter.py\
\
2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve? It will count the chosen words in an external file and then output them to a new file\
\
3. What will you learn from developing this program?\
Reading, parsing and writing to external files. \
\
4. What Python modules will your program use?\
datetime, math, and pytest.\
\
5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each\
perform a single task? Yes, I\'92ll be trying to separate each operation into as many functions that I can. I\'92ll try and not only accept user input in it\'92s own function but I\'92ll also have a function that counts the words (all the words in the external file) as well. And then another function that outputs the selection to a file.  \
\
6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions? yes, I\'92ll create a test functions that are in my file as needed. \
\
(Remember that it's hard to test functions that get user input and print\
output. It's easy to test functions that don't get user input and don't\
print output but instead have parameters and return a result. Therefore,\
you should write most of your program functions to have parameters and\
return a result.)\
